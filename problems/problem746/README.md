You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.
